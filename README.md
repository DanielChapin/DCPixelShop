# DCPixelShop
Software project I'm making that will allow for people to make pixel art.

If you use my software with any organization(school, work, game you're making, etc.), just shoot me an email at dchapes123@gmail.com
I would love to hear if anyone actually uses my software.

I will include the actual application closer to when it's done. Super early access.

Thanks and enjoy,
