# DCPixelShop
Software project I'm making that will allow for people to make 8-bit pixel art.

If you use my software with any organization(school, work, game you're making, etc.), just shoot me an email at dchapes123@gmail.com
I would love to hear if anyone actually uses my software so it's not like I'll hunt you down for copyright or something.
(And I don't expect you to get a liscence or anything)

Also, the libs included in this application are not in this repo. I will include the actual application closer to when it's done.
**Libs:**

Thanks and enjoy,

Daniel Chapin
